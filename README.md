# School District Analysis

# Overview

**Module 4 Challenge**: Thomas High School ninth-graders' reading and math grades appear to have been altered in the `students_complete.csv` file according to the school board. Even though the school board is unaware of the entire scope of the cheating, they are looking for assistance in upholding state testing requirements. Thomas High School's math and reading test scores should be replaced with NaN (Not a Number) values, but all other data should be left untouched. The school board wants to repeat the school district analysis conducted previously and receive a report about how these adjustments influenced the overall study once the reading and math scores have been replaced.

The analysis makes use of Python language Pandas library to review the data contained in the CSV file.

The Jupyter notebook contianing all the figures and datasets used for this report can be found at [PyCitySchools_Challenge_Final.ipynb](https://github.com/Peteresis/School_District_Analysis/blob/d692a11b75aac6d443415a7de0df3ded2d042fe7/PyCitySchools_Challenge_Final.ipynb){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

As the images above show, after changing to `NaN` the math and reading scores of all the **9th grade students at Thomas High School** there is almost no difference between the two summaries at district level.  It is worth noting that the the number of 9th Grade students at Thomas High School is 461, which represents 461/39170 = 1.18%.  The number of students have been extracted from the data in the CSV file
