# School District Analysis

# Overview

**Module 4 Challenge**: Thomas High School ninth-graders' reading and math grades appear to have been altered in the `students_complete.csv` file according to the school board. Even though the school board is unaware of the entire scope of the cheating, they are looking for assistance in upholding state testing requirements. Thomas High School's math and reading test scores should be replaced with NaN (Not a Number) values, but all other data should be left untouched. The school board wants to repeat the school district analysis conducted previously and receive a report about how these adjustments influenced the overall study once the reading and math scores have been replaced.

The analysis makes use of Python language Pandas library to review the data contained in the CSV file.
